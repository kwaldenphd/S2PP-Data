## Project History

This data collection project began in summer 2018 as a collaboration between Tammy Nyden and Katherine Walden, as part of ["The School to Prison Pipeline Project,"](https://mothersonthefrontline.com/2018/09/18/the-school-to-prison-pipeline-project/) an initiative supported by Mothers on the Front Lines and the Grinnell College Innovation Fund.

The first stage of data collection took place in the 2018-2019 academic year, led by Daisy Morales '20 through her work in the [Vivero Digital Scholarship Fellowship Program](https://vivero.sites.grinnell.edu/). Morales was responsible for identifying major data sources, downloading original datasets, documenting data gathered, and generating relevant metadata and contextual information about the datasets. Morales also gathered, organized, and inventoried the qualitative data included in this repository.

The initial round of data processing took place in Spring 2019 and was made possible through the support of the Data Analysis and Social Inquiry Lab (DASIL), supported by the [Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust's data science grant to Grinnell College.](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/carver-grant-helps-grinnell-faculty-students-think-big-data) DASIL student workers Cora Touchstone '19 (Economics and Mathematics) and Hollis Akins '22 (Physics) led that work, supervised and mentored by Jarren Santos '17 (DASIL Data Scientist) and Xavier Escandell (DASIL Director). Additional data processing took place in Fall 2019 and was undertaken by DASIL student worker Hollis Akins, supervised and mentored by Jarren Santos.

The collected data was made available for use by students enrolled in the [Fall 2019 course "The School-to-Prison Pipeline" and co-requisite digital lab "Digital Stories for Social Justice."](https://mothersonthefrontline.com/2018/09/18/the-school-to-prison-pipeline-project/)
