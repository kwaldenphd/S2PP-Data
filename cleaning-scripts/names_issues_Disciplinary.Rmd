This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

df1 <- read.csv(paste("To_Merge/",filenames[2],sep=""),check.names = F, stringsAsFactors = F)
df2 <- read.csv(paste("To_Merge/",filenames[1],sep=""),check.names = F, stringsAsFactors = F)

print(names(df1))
print(names(df2))

for (filename in filenames[-2]){
  df <- read.csv(paste("To_Merge/",filename,sep=""), check.names = F, stringsAsFactors = F)
  if (length(names(df))!=length(names(df1))){
    print(names(df))
    print(filename)
  }
  #print(names(df)[!(names(df) %in% names(df1))])
}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
