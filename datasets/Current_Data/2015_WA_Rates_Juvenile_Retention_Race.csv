"Note: To preserve the privacy of the juvenile residents  cell counts have been rounded to the nearest multiple of three.  Washington was the State where the juvenile committed the offense for which they were being held. However  the state of offense is not always reported. These instances are not evenly distributed across states. Visit the <a href="../asp/methods.asp#StateTables">EZACJRP methods</a> section for more information.  "

Note: The "Hispanic" category includes persons of Latin American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.  These persons are not included in the other race/ethnicity categories.
